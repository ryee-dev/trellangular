# Trellangular
###### By Roger Yee | 4/6/18

## Description
Trellangular was developed as a practice exercise for the implementation and utilization of the Angular javascript framework alongside Google's database service, Firebase. Trellangular's main attempt was not only to replicate the functionality of Trello, but really capture the aesthetic aspect as well.
